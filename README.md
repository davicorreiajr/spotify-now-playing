# Spotify Now Playing

Spotify Now Playing is a popup that shows Spotify current playback information, made and tested specially for macOS.

It also:

- Allows you to add tracks to your library and playlists from the interface.
- (Optionally) displays a notification in Notification Center.
  - Tested to be working on macOS 11.3.1 (Big Sur)!

## Installing

Download the `.dmg` file from the [latest release][latest-release], run it, and move the app to your 
system's `Application` folder.

Alternatively, using Homebrew:

```
brew install spotify-now-playing
```

### Compatibility with Linux

I tried to make the app compatible with Linux, but I've seen [this issue][linux-incompatibility-issue], which turns 
quite hard to make the app behaves as expected (let's say, as a menu bar app) on Linux. You can run the app locally,
but for now, I preferred to not release a version for Linux because it'd be far from what I (or any other user) would
expect. If you find a good solution, please don't hesitate to open an issue, or submit a pull request.

## Running locally

This app was made using Electron, but developed and tested only on macOS.

First, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/davicorreiajr/spotify-now-playing
cd spotify-now-playing
```

Install the dependencies:
```
yarn install
```
Then you have to create an app on Spotify, in order to get the codes necessary for doing the requests to its API. You
can do it easily, following [this tutorial][spotify-app-registration].

Once you have done this, rename `.env-example.json` (file in the root of this project) to `.env.json`.

Finally, start the app:

```
yarn start
```

If you are developing over this project and want to test the built app, the one generated by `electron-builder`, you
have to:

- Rename `electron-builder-example.yml` to `electron-builder.yml`;
- Generate a token with repo/scope permission [here][github-new-token], ONLY in case you want to release to your 
  GitHub repo. Remember to update the link to your repo in `package.json`.

To distribute a binary release:

```
yarn dist
```

With this command, you are going to find a `.dmg` file inside a new folder `dist`.
